 Hi, I’m @varun-roman
👀 I’m interested in DevOps practices, CI/CD pipelines, automation, and cloud technologies.
🌱 I’m currently learning container orchestration with Kubernetes and exploring infrastructure as code with Terraform.
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open-source DevOps projects or share knowledge about best practices.
